## How game was built

The starter project given by Udacity [link](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game.git) or download original files directly by clicking[here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game/archive/master.zip) had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I needed to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
